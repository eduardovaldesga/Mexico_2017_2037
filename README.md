The present data have been gathered from several sources with a strong concern to be as much as possible in agreement with real values to the Mexican situation. 

There are 50 regions of generation and 66 transmission lines. There are nine generation technology options for capacity additions include:  coal units, conventional steam units, gas turbines, gas combined cycle, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and hydro units.

The installed capacity of each region in 2016 appears in the file `ExiCap.txt` as a 50X9 matrix, where the rows are the regions  and the columns are the generation technologies. The installed capacity for the transmission lines appears in `ExiLin.txt`as a 66X9 matrix where each rows represent each transmission line. The first two columns are the tails nodes of the line, the third  column is the amount of installed capacity, the next columns represent the efficiency, the inversion cost for the installation of new line, the maintenance cost, the number of employments generated for the installation and the nu,ber of employments generated by maintenance, respectively. The number of employments are scaled to employment per transmited megawatt. <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> shows the geographical ubication of the generation regions, their names according to SENER Mexico and the transmission lines.

`TypPla.txt` has the information for each type of generation technology. Each row of the matrix represen the different technologies in order coal units, conventional steam units, gas turbines, gas combined cycle, nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and hydro units. The columns represent the capacity (MW) of each unit, the generation efficiency, the fuel consumption per megawatt, the using type of combustible, the tons of CO2 emmisions per megawatt, the inversion cost for open a new plant per MW, the maintenence cost per MW, the amount of national fuel available, the cost of fuel, the environmental impact for open a new plant per MW, the number of employments generated by the installation of a new plant and the generated employment per meaintenence per MW, respectively.

Depending of the type of resource using for generation, each region has a limited maximal capacity generation per technology. `AllTec.txt` has a region-technology matrix with the availables resources.

The forecast for the demand of the 21-planning of each region appears in `Dem.txt`. The reserve margin for the forecast of demand and for renewable resources, respectively, are in `ResMar.txt`.
